1.3GHz HD Digital Video Distribution Project for FPV

This is a hardware and software open source project to design a full HD system for FPV. Initially, this project will deliver
HD video over the 1.3GHz spectrum using a combination of H.264 encoding into a COFDM stream. The design can easily be modified
to use different spectrums such as 2.4GHz or 5.8GHz. This would be a simple change of the LO, RF mixer and RF amplifier
components.
